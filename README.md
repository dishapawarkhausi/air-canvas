# AirCanvas

**AirCanvas** is an innovative project that enables users to draw on a virtual canvas using hand gestures, specifically focusing on drawing with the index finger. The application uses **OpenCV** and **MediaPipe** to detect hand gestures and translate them into real-time drawing actions on the screen. The project also features additional functionalities such as adjustable pen thickness, color options, and an eraser tool to enhance the drawing experience.

## Features
- **Gesture-based Drawing**: Draw with your index finger, just like a real-world pen.
- **Pen Thickness**: Adjust the thickness of the pen to make your strokes bold or fine.
- **Color Options**: Choose different colors for drawing to make your artwork vibrant.
- **Eraser Tool**: Erase unwanted parts of the drawing easily.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: See the drawing instantly as you move your hand.
- **Air Gesture Detection**: Detect gestures with high accuracy using MediaPipe and OpenCV.

## Requirements

Make sure you have Python installed on your system. Then, install the necessary libraries:

```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy
```

## Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/dishapawarkhausi/air-canvas.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project folder:

    ```bash
    cd air-canvas
    ```

3. Install required dependencies (as shown above).

4. Run the main Python script:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## How It Works

- The application uses **OpenCV** to capture video feed from your camera.
- **MediaPipe** is used to detect hand gestures and the position of your fingers.
- Based on the position of your index finger, the application draws lines on the screen.
- You can change the pen color and thickness using on-screen controls, and use the eraser tool to remove parts of your drawing.
